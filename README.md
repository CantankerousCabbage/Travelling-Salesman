# Travelling-Salesman

Question 4. for CT Assignment 2

The Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP, often known as the Travelling Salesman
Problem) is a well-known example of an intractable problem. Compare the performance of a complete solution to this problem (i.e. one that uses an algorithm that
is guaranteed to always find a minimum) with two more efficient algorithms, which
could be either approximation algorithms, heuristics or other means. Your comparison should show the time taken in seconds for all three algorithms to some value
4
of n, which should correspond to your interpretation of some reasonable maximum
time for the complete algorithm (say 30 minutes). Whatever your maximum time
is, determine the largest value of n which can be solved in this time for each of the
more efficient solutions.
You should also describe what input data was used and how you obtained it.
Some possible efficient algorithms include the Christofides or Christofides-Serdyukov
algorithm, the double-tree algorithm, greedy algorithms, the Lin-Kernighan heuristic, and genetic algorithms
